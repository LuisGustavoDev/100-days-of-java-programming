# 100-days-of-java-programming

This repository contains my progress through the **100 Days of Java Programming** challenge. Over the next 100 days, I will be working on improving my skills in Java, covering a wide range of topics such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), advanced Java, frameworks, and real-world project development.

The goal is to commit to daily programming practice and build a strong foundation in Java.

## Day 1: Object-Oriented Programming in Java
Today, I learned about **inheritance**, **method overriding**, and **polymorphism** in Java. I applied these concepts by creating a class hierarchy, using the super() keyword to initialize shared attributes, and allowing subclasses to implement their own specialized behaviors.

## Day 2: Organizing and Structuring Code Efficiently

Today, I continued to explore concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, specifically focusing on **inheritance**, **method overriding**, and **polymorphism**. Additionally, I learned more about how to **organize and structure code efficiently**. I understood better how to leverage the **super()** keyword to initialize attributes of the parent class in subclasses. These techniques are crucial for creating a well-structured class hierarchy, where common behaviors are inherited, and specific behaviors are implemented in subclasses.

I'm looking forward to diving deeper into Java and continuing this journey. Stay tuned for updates as I progress in the challenge!
