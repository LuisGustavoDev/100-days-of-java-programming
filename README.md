# 100-days-of-java-programming

This repository contains my progress through the **100 Days of Java Programming** challenge. Over the next 100 days, I will be working on improving my skills in Java, covering a wide range of topics such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), advanced Java, frameworks, and real-world project development.

The goal is to commit to daily programming practice and build a strong foundation in Java.

### Day 1: Object-Oriented Programming in Java
Today, I learned about **inheritance**, **method overriding**, and **polymorphism** in Java. I applied these concepts by creating a class hierarchy, using the super() keyword to initialize shared attributes, and allowing subclasses to implement their own specialized behaviors.
