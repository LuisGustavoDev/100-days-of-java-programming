# 100 Days of Java Programming

This repository contains my progress through the **100 Days of Java Programming** challenge. Over the next 100 days, I will be working on improving my skills in Java, covering a wide range of topics such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), advanced Java, frameworks, and real-world project development.

The goal is to commit to daily programming practice and build a strong foundation in Java.

## Day 1-3: Object-Oriented Programming and Code Structuring in Java

**Objectives**: Learn core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** such as **inheritance**, **method overriding**, **polymorphism**, and **code structuring**.

- **Day 1**:
  - Practiced **inheritance**: Created a base class and extended it with specialized subclasses.
  - **Method overriding**: Modified the behavior of methods inherited from the superclass in the subclass.
  - Introduced to **polymorphism**: The ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in their own unique ways.

- **Day 2**:
  - Continued applying **inheritance** and **method overriding**.
  - Focused on **code structuring**: Used **super()** to initialize attributes from the parent class in subclasses.
  - Worked on organizing the code in a more modular way.

- **Day 3**:
  - Completed exercises involving **overriding methods** to provide different behaviors.
  - Focused on structuring code into clean, manageable pieces.

## Day 4-6: Collections in Java, Data Structures, and Static Methods

**Objectives**: Explore the use of **Collections** in Java, **static methods** and **fields**, and deepen understanding of **encapsulation** and **polymorphism**.

- **Day 4**:
  - Used **ArrayList** to store and manipulate objects dynamically.
  - Created the **ContactRepository** class to manage contacts, search by keywords, and display lists.
  - Applied **abstraction** and **polymorphism** to manage and filter data.

- **Day 5**:
  - Extended the project by adding a **Call Management System**.
  - Created **Call** and **CallRepository** classes to store call information.
  - Used **encapsulation** to manage call details and **polymorphism** by overloading the `call` method.
  - Implemented **LocalDateTime** and **DateTimeFormatter** to log call times.
  - Integrated **CallRepository** into the **CellPhone** class to track call history.

- **Day 6**:
  - Introduced **static methods** and **static fields**.
  - Created a **Math** class with static methods like `sum()`, `square()`, and `circleArea()`.
  - Used a static field (`piValue`) shared across all instances of the class.
  - Explored the difference between **static variables** and **instance variables**.

## Day 7-9: Working with Exceptions, Flow Control, and Abstract Classes

**Objectives**: Dive into **exceptions handling**, **flow control**, and **abstract classes**.

- **Day 7**:
  - Learned and practiced **exception handling** with **try-catch** blocks to capture and handle errors.
  - Explored creating **custom exceptions**.

- **Day 8**:
  - Introduced to **flow control** with **if-else**, **switch-case**, and **while loops**.
  - Practiced **iteration** over collections with loops.
  
- **Day 9**:
  - Implemented **abstract classes** to represent generic entities.
  - Studied the difference between **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.
